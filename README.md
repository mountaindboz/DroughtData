An R data package containing data sets used in the Drought Synthesis
project. This data package also contains useful metadata describing the
data sets, the processing scripts used to derive the data, and a couple
helper functions.

This package provides the following data tables:

- `lt_avg_hydro`: long-term (1975-2021) data set containing seasonal
  averages of three hydrology parameters (Delta Outflow, Delta Exports,
  X2)
- `lt_avg_wq`: long-term (1975-2021) data set containing
  seasonal-regional averages of three water quality parameters (water
  temperature, salinity, and secchi depth) within the the upper San
  Francisco Estuary (Delta)
- `raw_hydro_1975_2022`: a data set containing raw daily values of the
  hydrology and Low Salinity Zone (LSZ) metrics for 1975-2022 in the
  Delta
- `raw_wq_1975_2021`: a data set containing raw values of three water
  quality parameters (water temperature, salinity, and secchi depth) for
  1975-2021 within the Delta
- `raw_nutr_1975_2021`: a long-term data set containing raw values of
  three nutrient parameters (Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrate +
  Nitrite, and Dissolved Ortho-phosphate) for 1975-2021 within the Delta
- `raw_nutr_2013_2021`: a short-term data set containing raw values of
  three nutrient parameters (Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrate +
  Nitrite, and Dissolved Ortho-phosphate) for 2013-2021 within the Delta
- `cont_do_daily`: A data set containing daily average values of
  continuous dissolved oxygen data from 2014-2021 at a few locations in
  the Delta
- `raw_chla_1975_2021`: a long-term data set containing raw values of
  discrete chlorophyll-a water concentrations for 1975-2021 within the
  Delta

This package also contains the following helper functions specific to
the Drought Synthesis project:

- `drt_avg_data()`: Calculates seasonal and/or regional averages
- `drt_add_yr_assign()`: Adds year assignment information to a data
  frame. The year assignment information is used in the analyses for the
  Drought Synthesis.
- `drt_replace_rl()`: Replaces values measured below the analytical
  reporting limit with a random number
- `drt_color_pal_drought()` and `drt_color_pal_yrtype()`: Apply custom
  color palettes to the figures used in the Drought Synthesis report
