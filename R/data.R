#' @title Raw values of discrete chlorophyll-a water concentrations for 1975-2021
#' @description A long-term data set containing raw concentration values of
#'   chlorophyll-a in water samples collected within the upper San Francisco
#'   Estuary (Delta) from 1975-2021. Used in the analyses for the Drought
#'   Synthesis.
#'
#'   All data are from the `discretewq` data package. This data set contains
#'   only one data point per `Station` and `Date`.
#'
#' @format data frame with 19,887 rows and 13 columns
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Source}{Name of the source dataset. Either EMP (DWR's Environmental
#'     Monitoring Program), USGS_SFBS (USGS's San Francisco Bay Water Quality
#'     Survey), or DWR_NCRO (DWR's North Central Region Office)}
#'   \item{Station}{Location where sample was collected}
#'   \item{Latitude}{Latitude of `Station` in Decimal Degrees (WGS 84 Datum)}
#'   \item{Longitude}{Longitude of `Station` in Decimal Degrees (WGS 84 Datum)}
#'   \item{Region}{Region designation of `Station` within the larger Delta and
#'     Suisun Bay (Confluence, North, SouthCentral, Suisun Bay). The
#'     Drought Synthesis team categorized `SubRegion`s into broader `Region`s
#'     using [this
#'     crosswalk](https://github.com/mountaindboz/DroughtData/blob/master/data-raw/Global/Rosies_regions.csv)
#'   .}
#'   \item{SubRegion}{Subregion designation of `Station` as defined by the
#'     `R_EDSM_Subregions_Mahardja_FLOAT` shapefile from the
#'     [`deltamapr`](https://github.com/InteragencyEcologicalProgram/deltamapr)
#'     package.}
#'   \item{YearAdj}{Adjusted calendar year - December-November, with December of
#'     the previous calendar year included with the following year. For example,
#'     December of 2020 is assigned year "2021" in this data set.}
#'   \item{Season}{Winter (Dec-Feb), Spring (Mar-May), Summer (Jun-Aug), or Fall
#'     (Sept-Nov)}
#'   \item{Month}{Integer representing the month}
#'   \item{Date}{Calendar date of the measurement in yyyy-mm-dd}
#'   \item{Datetime}{Date and time (yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS) of the measurement in
#'     PST.}
#'   \item{Chlorophyll_Sign}{A symbol representing whether the chlorophyll-a
#'     value is below the reporting limit or above it. Contains one of two
#'     symbols: "<" or "=". "<" indicates that the value is below the Reporting
#'     Limit (RL) with the value in `Chlorophyll` equal to the RL. "=" indicates
#'     that the value was detected by the laboratory with the value in
#'     `Chlorophyll` equal to the actual value measured by the laboratory.}
#'   \item{Chlorophyll}{Chlorophyll-a concentration in micrograms per liter}
#' }
